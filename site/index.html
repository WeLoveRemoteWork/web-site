              The working life is constantly changing and thanks to great tools
              that enable working from anywhere, many industries are moving
              towards enabling it on some level.

              Remote work is gaining popularity faster than ever and there's so
              much we can learn from each other to build companies that enable
              remote and to live lives that work best for us.

              We are planning to start building the community and organize
              events and we're now looking for people interested in joining.
              Some local events will happen in Finland but to be true to remote,
              we'll make all of them also available to join remotely.
